There are 2 versions of my code, 'bd_fast.c' and 'bd_cell.c'

KINDLY set the number of threads inside the bd.c file (line 10)

The makefile runs the 'bd_fast.c' code (also saved as 'bd.c')
Please refer to the report (proj1.pdf) for the implementation details and probability calculations related to the 'bd_fast.c' algorithm.
